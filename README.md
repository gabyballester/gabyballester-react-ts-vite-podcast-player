## Tech Assessment: Podcaster

For this techn assessment, IÂ´ve recreated a podcast player using the Apple Podcast API."

## Candidate: Gabriel Ballester

### Made with: React + TypeScript + Vite

In this repository, you will find a README file detailing how to run the application in both modes: development (dev) and production (build).

### Running the Project

#### Development Mode (dev)

To run the application in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the following command to start the development server: `yarn dev`.

#### Production Mode (build)

To generate a production-ready build of the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed steps 1-3 from the development mode.
2. Run the following command to build the production version: `yarn build`

This will generate an optimized version of the application in the dist folder.

To view the production version, you can use live-server or a similar tool.

Thank you for taking the time to review the project. :+1:
